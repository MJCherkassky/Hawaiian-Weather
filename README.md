# Surfs Up!

This project hopes to understand Hawaiian weather trends by analyzing and interpreting previously recorded weather data. I created a connection between my Jupyter Notebook and a SQLite databvase using SQL Alchemy. Once connected, I view the database tables, query & plot the last 12 months of precipitation data, maniuplate objects, and save the combined results to a Pandas DataFrame. After sorting the DataFrame, I use MatPlotLib to visualize the total number of recorded data points for rainfall from the top 10 nost active weather stations, as well as some temperature observation visualization. Deployed via Flask.

View my Jupyter Notebook to see the steps I took to accomplish this.
